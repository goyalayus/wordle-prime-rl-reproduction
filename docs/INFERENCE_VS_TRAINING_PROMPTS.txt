INFERENCE VS TRAINING PROMPTS
================================================================================

1. WERE THE PROMPTS THE SAME?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. The inference system prompt and user prompt format are different from the 
training dataset.


2. INFERENCE SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are an expert AI playing Wordle.
GOAL: Guess the secret 5-letter word in 6 tries.

FEEDBACK MEANING (per letter):
- G (Green): correct letter in the correct position.
- Y (Yellow): letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- X (Gray): letter is not in the word.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
<guess>[word]</guess>

[word] must be exactly 5 lowercase letters a-z.


3. TRAINING SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a competitive game player. Make sure you read the game instructions 
carefully, and always follow the required format.

In each turn, think step-by-step inside <<think>>...<<</think> tags, then follow 
the instructions inside <<guess>>...<<</think> tags.

Note: The training dataset uses double-angle brackets: <<think>> and <<guess>>, 
not single-angle <think> and <guess>.


4. DIFFERENCES SUMMARY

5. SIMPLE MODEL OUTPUT FROM TRAINING DATASET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- User message (first turn) ---

You are Player 0 in Wordle.
A secret 5-letter word has been chosen. You have 6 attempts to guess it.
For each guess, wrap your word in square brackets (e.g., [apple]).
Feedback for each letter will be given as follows:
 - G (green): correct letter in the correct position
 - Y (yellow): letter exists in the word but in the wrong position
 - X (wrong): letter is not in the word
Enter your guess to begin.


--- Model output (first guess) ---

<<think>>
I'll start with a common 5-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants 
to gather initial feedback. A good starting word is "CRANE" because it includes 
common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
<<</think>>>
<<guess>>[crane]<<</think>>>


--- User message (feedback) ---

C R A N E
X X G G G

You have 5 guesses left.


--- Model output (second guess) ---

<<think>>
The feedback for "[crane]" is: C (X), R (X), A (G), N (G), E (G). This means:
- A, N, E are correct and in the correct positions (positions 3, 4, 5).
- C and R are not in the word at all.

So the word structure is: _ _ A N E.

Now, I need to find a 5-letter word that fits _ _ A N E, excluding C and R.
I'll try "PLANE" — P and L are new letters, A N E stay in place.
<<</think>>>
<<guess>>[plane]<<</think>>>


6. BOTTOM LINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Training format:   <<guess>>[word]<<</think>>> with the word in square brackets
Inference format:  <guess>[word]</guess>

Conclusion: There is a train-test mismatch. Aligning inference prompts and tags 
with the training dataset may improve performance.


================================================================================
7. DOES OUR MODEL DO "WORD STRUCTURE" STYLE REASONING? (from inference_results_fixed.json)
================================================================================

NO. I searched the inference JSON for patterns like:
  - "word structure"
  - "structure is"
  - "_ _ " (underscore placeholders)
  - "So the word structure is: _ _ A N E"

Result: ZERO matches.

OUR MODEL DOES:
  - Parse feedback letter by letter (Position 1: C, Position 2: R, etc.)
  - Try to map G/Y/X to each position
  - Often gets confused about what G/Y/X mean
  - Often concludes "So the word is C R A N E" incorrectly
  - Never writes "word structure" or uses underscore placeholders like _ _ A N E

TRAINING DATA DOES:
  - Explicitly says "So the word structure is: _ _ A N E"
  - Uses underscore placeholders for unknown positions
  - Clean step-by-step reasoning that leads to a coherent next guess

So our fine-tuned model does NOT imitate the training data's "word structure" 
reasoning style. It uses a different, messier style and often misinterprets
G/Y/X.
